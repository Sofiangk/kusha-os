# Phase 3: Clients Module - Implementation Complete âœ“

## What Was Built

### Database

-   **clients** table with:
    -   Arabic name (name_ar)
    -   Unique phone number
    -   Optional Arabic address
    -   Notes field
    -   Analytics fields (total_orders, total_spent)
    -   Soft deletes
    -   Creator tracking

### Model

-   **Client.php** with:
    -   Relationships to creator, orders (will be used in Phase 4)
    -   Helper method to check if client has orders
    -   Soft delete support

### Controller

-   **ClientController.php** with:
    -   Full CRUD operations
    -   Search functionality (name/phone)
    -   Filter for recurring clients (3+ orders)
    -   Deletion protection (blocks if client has orders)
    -   Special endpoint: search by phone (for order creation workflow)

### Seeder

-   **ClientSeeder.php** with:
    -   15 realistic Arabic client names
    -   Libyan phone numbers
    -   Libyan addresses
    -   Variety of order counts and spending
    -   Mix of new clients and loyal customers

### Routes

All under `/api/v1` and protected by `auth:sanctum`:

-   GET `/clients` - List all (with search & recurring filters)
-   POST `/clients` - Create new
-   GET `/clients/{id}` - Show one
-   PUT `/clients/{id}` - Update
-   DELETE `/clients/{id}` - Soft delete (with protection)
-   POST `/clients/search-phone` - Quick lookup by phone

## Key Features

-   âœ… Arabic-first client data
-   âœ… Phone uniqueness enforced
-   âœ… Soft deletes preserve order history
-   âœ… Deletion protection for clients with orders
-   âœ… Quick phone search for order workflow
-   âœ… Analytics fields (total_orders, total_spent)
-   âœ… Creator tracking for audit trail

## Sample Data (15 Clients)

Clients range from:

-   New clients (1-2 orders, 30-60 LYD spent)
-   Regular clients (3-9 orders, 90-300 LYD spent)
-   VIP clients (10+ orders, 400+ LYD spent)

## How It Links to Orders (Phase 4)

When we build Orders in Phase 4:

-   Each Order will have a `client_id` foreign key
-   Order creation will support: search existing client by phone OR create new client
-   Order totals will automatically update client's `total_spent` and `total_orders`
-   Deletion protection ensures no orphaned orders

Ready for Phase 4: Orders & Order Items! ðŸš€
