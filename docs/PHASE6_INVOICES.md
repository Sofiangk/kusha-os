# Phase 6: Invoice Generation - Implementation Complete ✓

## What Was Built

### InvoiceController

Invoice generation system that creates structured JSON invoices from orders:

1. **List Invoices** - Get all invoices (from orders) with filtering
2. **Show Invoice** - Get full invoice details for a specific order
3. **Generate Invoice** - Generate invoice for an order

## API Endpoints

All under `/api/v1` and protected by `auth:sanctum`.
